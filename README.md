## Topic Outline

- History of neural networks and what makes deep learning different from “classic machine learning”
- Introduction to the concept of neural networks by connecting it to familiar concepts such as logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression (which can be seen as special cases: single-layer neural nets)
- Modeling and deriving non-convex loss function through computation graphs
- Introduction to automatic differentiation and PyTorch for efficient data manipulation using GPUs
- Convolutional neural networks for image analysis
- 1D convolutions for sequence analysis
- Sequence analysis with recurrent neural networks
- Generative models to sample from input distributions
  - Autoencoders
  - Variational autoencoders
  - Generative Adversarial Networks
